Most of the diagrams will be kept in here.
These include my git workflow, my CI/CD workflow, other projects as well as other repo diagrams.
Make sure to make a note in the other repo to reference the required diagram from here.
These diagrams are either Mermaid Markdown types or diagrams.net drawio xml types.
